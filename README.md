### How It Works:
Our website operates by using an ML model trained on the massive [MassGIS](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massgis-data-layers) massachusetts dataset to predict
the best choice of house for a potential buyer.

Parameters include housing related choices such as the *number of rooms*, *maximum price*, etc.
