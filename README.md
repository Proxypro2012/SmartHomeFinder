### How It Works:
Our website operates by using an ML model trained on the massive [MassGIS](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massgis-data-layers) massachusetts dataset to predict
the best choice of house for a potential buyer.

Parameters include housing related choices such as the *number of rooms*, *maximum price*, etc.


## 📘 Real-World Example: Meet Alex

Alex is a 32-year-old remote software engineer who’s planning to move to Massachusetts. He doesn't just want any house — he wants one that fits his *lifestyle, habits, and future goals*.

### 🧠 Alex’s Priorities

Alex visits SmartHomeFinder and enters the following preferences:

🔁 Then it **ranked** all available homes in Massachusetts, showing Alex the **top 5 most compatible homes** with a personalized **Match Score**.
